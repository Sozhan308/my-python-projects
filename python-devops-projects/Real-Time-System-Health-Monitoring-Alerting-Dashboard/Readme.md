# **Project Title:** Real-Time System Health Monitoring and Alerting Dashboard

## **Overview:**
The project involves developing a **real-time system health monitoring solution** for multiple servers. The goal is to monitor system metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage, alert administrators when thresholds are breached, and visualize the data in a Grafana dashboard. This project can be scaled to enterprise-level monitoring.

---

## **Project Scope:**
1. Monitor system health on **multiple servers** (e.g., Linux and Windows).
2. Push metrics to a centralized **time-series database** (Prometheus or InfluxDB).
3. Trigger **email alerts** for critical thresholds.
4. Create a Grafana dashboard for real-time visualization.
5. Maintain logs of all alerts and metrics locally and on a central logging server.

---

## **Use Cases:**
1. **DevOps Teams:** Monitor servers hosting CI/CD pipelines and critical applications.
2. **IT Operations:** Track resource utilization across data centers.
3. **Developers:** Get insights into system performance for resource-heavy applications.

---

## **Project Architecture:**

### **High-Level Design:**
1. **Metric Collection Agents:**
   - Lightweight Python scripts running on each monitored server.
   - Use the `psutil` module to gather system stats.
   - Push data to a central monitoring server or database.

2. **Alerting System:**
   - Based on thresholds, agents send alerts via email using `smtplib`.
   - Alerts are logged for auditing purposes.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Centralized Grafana dashboard pulls metrics from Prometheus or InfluxDB.
   - Use Python scripts or exporters to feed metrics into the time-series database.

4. **Centralized Logging:**
   - Use `logging` to record metrics and events locally.
   - Push logs to a central logging server (e.g., Elasticsearch or Logstash).

---

## **Detailed Features:**

### **1. Metric Collection:**
- Gather metrics:
  - CPU usage (%)
  - Memory usage (%)
  - Disk space usage (%)
- Agent is compatible with Linux and Windows OS using the `platform` module.

### **2. Alerting System:**
- Send email alerts when thresholds are breached.
- Include detailed metrics in the email body:
  ```plaintext
  Alert: High CPU Usage Detected
  Server: server01
  CPU Usage: 92%
  Memory Usage: 78%
  Disk Usage: 65%
  ```
- Support additional notification channels (e.g., Slack, Teams).

### **3. Centralized Metric Storage:**
- Push metrics to Prometheus using Python's `requests` or `urllib3` modules to create HTTP POST requests.
- Alternatively, use InfluxDB with Python’s InfluxDB client.

### **4. Grafana Dashboard:**
- Pre-build panels for:
  - CPU usage trend.
  - Memory usage trend.
  - Disk usage trend.
- Configure alerts in Grafana for real-time notifications.

### **5. Centralized Logging:**
- Log metrics locally using `logging`.
- Periodically upload logs to a central server for analysis using `paramiko` or an SFTP library.

### **6. Extensibility:**
- Add custom metrics (e.g., network bandwidth using `scapy`).
- Support container monitoring by extending the script to collect Docker metrics.

---

## **Implementation Steps:**

### **Phase 1: Metric Collection**
1. Write a Python agent to collect metrics using `psutil`.
2. Ensure platform compatibility using the `platform` module.
3. Store metrics in a local JSON file for initial testing.

### **Phase 2: Alerting**
1. Configure thresholds in a `config.yaml` file.
2. Trigger alerts via email using `smtplib` when thresholds are breached.
3. Log alert details locally.

### **Phase 3: Centralized Metric Storage**
1. Set up a Prometheus or InfluxDB instance.
2. Push metrics using Python’s HTTP libraries (`requests` or `urllib3`).

### **Phase 4: Visualization**
1. Create a Grafana dashboard with panels for CPU, memory, and disk usage.
2. Configure Grafana alerts for additional notifications.

### **Phase 5: Centralized Logging**
1. Write a script to transfer local logs to a central logging server.
2. Use tools like Elasticsearch for log storage and Kibana for log visualization.

### **Phase 6: Testing**
1. Simulate high loads to test thresholds and alerts.
2. Verify data accuracy in Grafana.

## **Tech Stack:**
1. **Python Modules:**
   - `psutil`, `platform`, `requests`, `smtplib`, `logging`, `paramiko`, `PyYAML`
2. **Monitoring Tools:**
   - Prometheus (or InfluxDB)
   - Grafana
3. **Logging Tools:**
   - Elasticsearch and Kibana (optional)
4. **Infrastructure:**
   - Linux and Windows servers (for testing).

## **Outcome:**
By the end of this project, you will have:
- A fully functional system monitoring solution.
- Real-time alerts for critical system metrics.
- A visually appealing Grafana dashboard for tracking trends.
- A scalable and extensible monitoring framework.
